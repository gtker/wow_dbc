//! Implementation of the [DBC (`DataBaseClient`) file format for World of Warcraft 1.12, 2.4.3.8606, and 3.3.5.12340](https://wowdev.wiki/DBC).
//! This is auto generated from `.xml` files [in the github repository](https://github.com/gtker/wow_dbc/tree/main/rxml/xml).
//!
//! DBC files are inside [the MPQ files](https://wowdev.wiki/MPQ) that are included with the client.
//! This library does not deal with MPQ files.
//! You will have to extract the DBC files from the MPQ using another tool.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`vanilla_tables`], [`tbc_tables`], and [`wrath_tables`] modules contain submodules with table definitions.
//! Each table always has two types (using [`vanilla_tables::item_class`] as an example):
//!
//! 1. The table: [`ItemClass`](`vanilla_tables::item_class::ItemClass`). Which implements [`DbcTable`].
//! 2. The table row: [`ItemClassRow`](`vanilla_tables::item_class::ItemClassRow`). Which is accessed through [`DbcTable::rows`].
//!
//! Tables that have a primary key additionally have a type suffixed with `Key` ([`ItemClassKey`](`vanilla_tables::item_class::ItemClassKey`)),
//! and the table ([`ItemClass`](`vanilla_tables::item_class::ItemClass`)) implements the [`Indexable`] trait.
//!
//! [`Gender`] and [`SizeClass`] are in the crate root because they are used in multiple tables and have been de-duplicated in order to reduce the amount of types in the crate.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! wow_dbc = { version = "0.3.0", features = ["vanilla", "tbc", "wrath"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Or add it with [cargo edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit):
//! ```bash
//! cargo add wow_dbc --features "vanilla tbc wrath"
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! By default no features are enabled.
//! The following features are valid:
//! * `vanilla`, for 1.12 client data.
//! * `tbc`, for 2.4.3.8606 client data.
//! * `wrath`, for 3.3.5.12340 client data.
//!
//! To add only a specific version, remove the unneeded ones from the `features` list above.
//!
//! # Tests
//!
//! Published builds do not have any tests for individual tables,
//! but these can be built by changing `BUILD_TESTS` in `rxml/src/main.rs` of the repository.
//! These require the original DBC files from the client which can not be republished.
//! The DBC files must be placed in the root of the repository.
//!
